- Hi, my name is Kevin.
- I'm a video game artist, animator, developer and music composer from Argentina.
- Since I'm more focused on art and music than programming, I have neater profiles at ktvx94.artstation.com and soundcloud.com/ktvx94. 
- However, if you're looking for a one-man-army Unity game dev, you're in the right place! I work perfectly in tight teams where versatility and vision are needed most.
- Feel free to contact me at ktvx94@gmail.com
